Ideally open the file with a live server otherwise due to CORS the audio visualiser in music.html will not work. But the rest of the website will.
Open index.html for home page. 
Use navigation to browse other pages.
All other pages have basically the same skeleton as the home page as I just copy pasted the code and then modified but football, music and contact page have something special. 
Movies page has nothing special.
Football page has an animated slider.
Contact page has a working contact form.

****Open the music page with a live server if possible otherwise due to CORS the music file will not play and the visualiser will be blank****
***VS Code has a live server extension that can be used to be able to see the visualiser in the music page***

Music page has an audio visualiser.

I could have bypassed the CORS by using base64 but that made the code too lengthy and I could have let the user pick which music file to play but while I could have implemented it 
I didnt realise this wouldnt work without live server until it got too late ðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜¥.
